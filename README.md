Alien Invasion Game

Project Description:

"Alien Invasion" is a 2D video game built using the Pygame library. The player controls a spaceship, shoots at invading aliens, and aims to achieve the highest possible score. 
The objective is to eliminate the alien fleet before they reach the bottom of the screen or destroy the spaceship.

Technologies and Tools:

Programming Language: Python
Library: Pygame
Development Environment: PyCharm

Features:

Dynamic generation of an alien fleet with changing movement direction.
Smooth spaceship control using keyboard inputs (arrows and spacebar for shooting).
Real-time display of the current score and high score on the screen.
Life system: the game ends after losing all lives or colliding with aliens.

Highlights:

This project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python. 
Classes are used to model the game, manage objects, handle animations, and detect collisions. It showcases the ability to develop interactive applications with real-time mechanics and engaging gameplay.
